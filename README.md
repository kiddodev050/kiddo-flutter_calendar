# Calendar

Shows a scrolling calendar list of events.  This is still relatively basic, it always
assumes that the getEvents returns the entire list of calendar events (mostly ignoring
the values passed into the source).  It does work however :)  Right now it also assumes
there is an asset at assets/images/calendarheader.png which it will use to display the header
and an asset at assets/images/calendarbanner.jpg which it will use for the month header.
